# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This project uses sequelize to create and edit a database on the backend of a server. This is my first assigment that uses sequelize and it taught me many of its ins and outs in terms of its functionality and syntax. 

## Installation
Before using the server to edit the database, run "npm i" to install the dependencies needed for proper functionality. Next, open postgres in the terminal and run the schema file. Finally run, the seeds index to install all seeds into the database. 

## Usage
In order to use the database routes, run the server with command "node server.js". Now that the server is running, you can use the various GET, POST, PUT abd DELETE methods to edit the database.
